** ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION................
      Asymptotic notation in data structures is a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, particularly as the input size grows very large.
       It focuses on how the algorithm's runtime or memory usage scales, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms.


** BIG 'O' NOTATION ........
      Big O notation is a mathematical tool used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of:

      * Time complexity (how long it takes to run)
      * Space complexity (how much memory it uses)

     Helps predict performance for large inputs

** SEARCH ALGORITHMS COMPLEXITIES........

       Linear serach=
            best case -> O(1)
            average case -> O(n)
            worst case -> O(n)

       Binary serach=
            best case -> O(1)
            average case -> O(logn)
            worst case -> O(logn)


** BETTER SEARCHING TECHNIQUE...........

      * Linear Search is better if:
         Data is unsorted and small.
         Frequent inserts/updates are done without sorting.

      * Binary Search is better if:
         Data is large and relatively static.
         Performance is crucial (faster search times).
